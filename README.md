# Ninjago
Lego Ninjago addon for Lucraft Core

If you want to download the addon, go to releases and download the file there. Downloading the code may cause files that are not required to be downladed.

Remember to unzip the file, then move it to your addonpacks folder. (The folder should have the same name as the zip file, without the .zip)

If there are any issues, please report them in the issues tab. I am more likely to see them here than a message on Discord.
